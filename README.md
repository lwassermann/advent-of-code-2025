# Advent of Code 2025

Playing with Elixir outside of a Phoenix App, solving the puzzles from
[AoC2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). Let's see how far I get 🙂.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `advent_of_code_2025` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:advent_of_code_2025, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/advent_of_code_2025>.
