# Advent of Code 2025

Playing with Elixir outside of a Phoenix App, solving the puzzles from
[AoC2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). Let's see how far I get 🙂.

There are minimal ceremonies with each days scripts. The day-data is expected in
`/data`-files. To run a day, run that specific day with `elixir lib/day&lt;nn&gt;.ex`.
Or run them with `mix compile`.

There are some tests around the core data functions, and for most days the
examples as well.
